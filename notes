sit gets confused if you eliminate it
how do I deal with that?
I could keep a count of number of matches, vs number of non matches

if you get done to 0 guesses use the highest of matches-non-matches.

or.. if you get to a list
this would mean things that it doesn't know about would get guessed less
    import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;  
    import java.time.LocalDateTime;    
    public class CurrentDateTimeExample1 {    
      public static void main(String[] args) {    
       DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss");  
       LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();  
       System.out.println(dtf.format(now));  
      }    
    }
